*Install a working version of Portaudio*

You'll can copy a working version of portaudio with this command:

scp -r mg8:portaudio ~

*Build it by your own*

You can skip this, if you use the binaries.

For solving the problems wiht portaudio on the mindgarage computers,
we have to install the package

  - libasound-dev

and compile portaudio

  - pa_stable_v190600_20161030.tgz

To do this configure the package with

./configure --prefix=$HOME/portaudio --with-alsa --without-oss
make
make install

and extend the LD_LIBRARY_PATH (for the user) by

*Setup environment to use new portaudio*

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$HOME/portaudio/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

Maybe you should put this into ~/.bashrc


Alternatively install to /usr/local
